## Intro
- Proposing a simple approach that can achieve robust layout control without requiring training or fine-tuning the image generator. Specifically, propose **layout guidance**, manipulates the cross-attention layers that the model uses to interface textual and visual information and steers the reconstruction in the desired direction given, e.g., a user-specified layout.

- Also, this paper shows some analytic results that while there is an intuitive correlation between different concepts and their visual extent, this correlation is more nuanced than one might think, and show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, the filler tokens in the sentences (the start tokens and padding tokens), actually carry significant information in the image generation process.
## Method
- An overview of the two layout guidance strategies: The cross-attention map for a chosen word token is marked with a red border.![|400](../Pasted%20image%2020231009004021.png)

## Conclusion from ü¶ñ
- Layout Guidance works have always talked that the cross-attention masking is important. Provided analysis on this paper was not that surprising.

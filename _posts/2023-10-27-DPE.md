## Intro
- Top: disentanglement of pose and expression. Bottom: general video editing![](../source/스크린샷%202023-10-27%20오전%209.15.20.png)
- “One-shot video-driven talking face generation, using novel self-supervised disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression without 3DMMs and paired data.”
- “Head pose and facial expression are always entangled in facial motion and transferred simultaneously.”
- “One challenge of decoupling pose and expression is the lack of paired data, such as the same pose but different expressions. Only a few methods attempt to tackle this challenge with the feat of 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) for explicit disentanglement. But 3DMMs are not accurate enough to capture facial details due to the limited number of Blenshapes, which has side effects on motion transfer.”

- “The editing module projects faces into a latent space where pose motion and expression motion can be disentangled, and the pose or expression transfer can be performed in the latent space conveniently via addition. The two generators render the modified latent codes to images, respectively. Moreover, to guarantee the disentanglement, we propose a bidirectional cyclic training strategy with well-designed constraints.”

- “Our model contains three learnable components, i.e., the motion editing module, the expression generator, and the pose generator.”
## Method
- “These two generators share the same architecture but different parameters for interpreting the pose and expression code respectively.”
- “Inspired by the flow-based methods [24, 25], we use flow fields to manipulate the feature maps. Fig. 2 gives an illustration of the generators. Similar to the pipeline of StyleGAN2 [16], we exploit the latent code to generate multiscale flow fields that are used to warp the feature maps from the encoder in the motion editing module.”![](../source/Pasted%20image%2020231028002531.png)
- “As shown in Fig. 3, the three dash lines indicate that three pairs of images can be used to compute reconstruction losses, i.e., < S′′, D >, < D′′, S >, and < S′, D′ >.”

- “Fortunately, we discover that the self-reconstruction of the two generators is core for the disentanglement, i.e., the pair < S, e(S, S) > and < S, p(S, S) >.”![](../source/Pasted%20image%2020231028002544.png)

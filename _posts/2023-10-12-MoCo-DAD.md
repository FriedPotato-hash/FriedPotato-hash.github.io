## Intro
- This last approach successfully accounts for the openset‚Äôness of anomalies, i.e., anything mapped outside the normality region is considered abnormal. However, forcing normality into constrained volumes may not work for diverse-but-still-normal behaviors, i.e., OCC misclassifies as anomalous those not fitting in the volume.‚Äù (Flaborea Îì±, 2023, p. 2) 
- ‚Äúboth normality and abnormality are multimodal‚Äù (Flaborea Îì±, 2023, p. 2)
- ‚ÄúWe consider human motion as skeletal representations and propose corrupting the body joint coordinates at each frame by displacing them with random translations.‚Äù (Flaborea Îì±, 2023, p. 2)
## Method
- During the forward process q, we corrupt the coordinates of the joints by adding random translation noise.
- ‚ÄúWe sample a random displacement map3 Œµk+1:N ‚àà R(N‚àík)√ó|J|√óC from a distribution N (0, I) and add it to Xk+1:N to randomly translate the position of its nodes.‚Äù

- ‚Äúbeing conditioned on the timestep t, we add the embedding œÑŒ∏(t) to the latent h and feed the resulting motiontemporal signal to each layer of our network ŒµŒ∏![|400](../Pasted%20image%2020231013214232.png)

## Conclusion from ü¶ñ
- I never thought that diffusion could be used at anormaly detection task, quite new to me.
- oneday, i wanna study this subject further.
